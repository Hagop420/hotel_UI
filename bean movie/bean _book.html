      <p>Its a nice cool relaxing day at the Royal National Gallery in London, where there is a meeting taking place. In this meeting the gentelmen discuss a trip to America and who will represent their main representative. They also discuss how Mr. Bean is the worst employee they ever had and the worst employee in the Gallerie's history.</p>

      <p id='mt2'>After, the assistant brings the gentelmen coffee and one of the gentelmen tells the lady to bring Mr Bean to the table to fire him, 'marvelous' se said and goes in to bring in Bean. While waiting with him for the gentelmen to let him in Bean thought its a good idea to make his talent shine once more by blowing his nose so hard te paper gets stuck in his nose.</p>
